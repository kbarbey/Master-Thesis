# Project progress

## Week 1 :  

1. Read articles : Binnenfeld et al. (2021), Anderson(2018) and SzÃ©kely, Izzo(2016)
2. Set up SPARTA code -> some dependencies problems with python 3.7. Requirements.txt needs to be updated. 
    2.1 Works with python 3.8 though. 
    2.2 Had to change code in USURPER.py because lists are not accepted in nopython mode of numba. Changed them to numpy objects instead.
    2.3 Trying the examples and tutorials.
