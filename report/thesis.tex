\dedication{\textbf{Pumbaa}: Hey, Timon, ever wonder what those sparkly dots are up there? \\

\textbf{Timon}: Pumbaa, I don’t wonder, I know.\\

\textbf{Pumbaa}: Oh. What are they?\\

\textbf{Timon}: They’re fireflies. Fireflies that, uh… got stuck up on that big bluish-black thing.\\

\textbf{Pumbaa}: Oh, gee. I always thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away.\\

\textbf{Timon}: Pumbaa, with you, everything’s gas.\\
